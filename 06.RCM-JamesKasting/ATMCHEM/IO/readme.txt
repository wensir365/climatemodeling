The subdirectory IO contains the input and output files generated by
the photochemical or the climate code when they are used in the loosely 
coupled way. 

+ atm_composition.dat 
+ atm_composition.out
These two files have the exact same format. They contain the atmospheric 
chemistry to start the model. At the end of a run  atm_composition.out is
generated. To start form the last solution copy atm_composition.out to
atm_composition.dat 
Before you run the program for the first time both files are identical.

*** INPUT FILES
+ input_photo.dat
Input parameters for the code.

+ planet.dat
Data for the planet.

+ fromClima2Photo.dat
Temperature and water profiles from the climate code. The file in the 
subdirectory before you run the program in a coupled mode correspons to 
a coupled converged run for present Earth around the Sun.

+ mixing_ratios.dat
Surface mixing ratios used when the the photochemical and climate 
models are used in a coupled way.

*** OUTPUT FILES
NOTE: Before you run the program for the first time only fromPhoto2Clima.dat
will be present. This file corresponds to a coupled converged run for 
present Earth around the Sun.
 
+ fromPhoto2Clima.dat
Water and ozone profiles to be transfered to the climate code

+ h2omixing.out
Output file with the mixing ratio of H2O vs. altitude

+ spectra_info.dat
Profiles to generate the planetary spectrum with SMART.

+ O3numdens.out
Output file with the ozone numebr density (cm^-3) vs. altitude
