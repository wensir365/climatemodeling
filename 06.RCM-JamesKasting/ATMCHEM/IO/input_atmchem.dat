c    STARR - Character variable to choose a star, it can be:
c             Sun, F2V, K2V,dMV 
c    FLUXFAC = Factor to multiply all the stellar spectra 
c     (to go back in time when the sun was fainter or to "move" the planet)
c    INIT = Choose 1 to force the program to start with constant mixing ratio 
c    for species like CH4, H2, CH3Cl,CO and N2O (this option should be used 
c    together with the boundary condition LBOUND = 1) 
c    TSTOP= Final time. The run will stop when the program runs for NSTEPS 
c     or when it arrives to TSTOP, whatever happens first.
c    DT = Initial time step.
c    NSTEPS=  Total steps
C     ZY = SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE (IN DEGREES)
C     AGL = DIURNAL AVERAGING FACTOR FOR PHOTORATES
C     ISEASON = TELLS WHETHER P AND T VARY WITH TIME (THEY DON'T FOR
C               ISEASON < 3)
C     IZYO2 = TELLS WHETHER SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE VARIES WITH TIME (0 SAYS
C             IT DOESN'T; 1 SAYS IT DOES)
C     IO2 = 0 FOR ALLEN AND FREDERICK O2 SCHUMANN-RUNGE COEFFICIENTS
C         = 1 FOR EXPONENTIAL SUM FITS (FOR LOW-O2 ATMOSPHERES)
C     INO = 0 FOR ALLEN AND FREDERICK NO PREDISSOCIATION COEFFICIENTS
C         = 1 FOR MODIFIED CIESLIK AND NICOLET FORMULATION
C     EPSJ = AMOUNT BY WHICH TO PERTURB THINGS FOR JACOBIAN CALCULATION
C     ZTROP = TROPOPAUSE HEIGHT (ABOVE WHICH H2O BEHAVES AS A NONCONDENS
C             ABLE GAS)
C     STARR - Character variable to choose a star, it can be:
c             Sun, F2V, K2V, G2V,MdV 
c             G2V is NOT the Sun. Write it exactly as it is listed
c             DO NOT FORGET quotation marks
c     ICOUPLE - 1 = Coupled to the climate model              
c               0 = Not coupled
C     FCO2 = CO2 mixing ratio when ICOUPLE = 0
C     FO2 = O2 mixing ratio when ICOUPLE = 0
C     DT = INITIAL TIME STEP
C     TSTOP = TIME AT WHICH CALCULATION IS TO STOP
C     NSTEPS = NUMBER OF TIME STEPS TO RUN (IF TSTOP IS NOT REACHED)
 OF TIME STEPS TO RUN (IF TSTOP IS NOT REACHED)
TOP IS NOT REACHED)
ME STEPS TO RUN (IF TSTOP IS NOT REACHED)
