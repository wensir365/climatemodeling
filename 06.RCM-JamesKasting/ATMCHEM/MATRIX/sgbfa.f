	subroutine sgbfa(abd,lda,n,ml,mu,ipvt,info)
      integer lda,n,ml,mu,ipvt(*),info
      real abd(lda,*)
c
c     sgbfa factors a real band matrix by elimination.
c
c     sgbfa is usually called by sgbco, but it can be called
c     directly with a saving in time if  rcond  is not needed.

c        abd     real(lda, n)
c                contains the matrix in band storage.  the columns

c        abd     an upper triangular matrix in band storage and
c                the multipliers which were used to obtain it.
c                the factorization can be written  a = l*u  where
c                l  is a product of permutation and unit lower
c                triangular matrices and  u  is upper triangular.

c                     indicate that sgbsl will divide by zero if
c                     called.  use  rcond  in sgbco for a reliable
c                     indication of singularity.

c
c           if  a  is a band matrix, the following program segment
c           will set up the input.
c

c                   mu = (band width above the diagonal)

c                20 continue
c
c           this uses rows  ml+1  through  2*ml+mu+1  of  abd .
c           in addition, the first  ml  rows in  abd  are used for
c           elements generated during the triangularization.
c           the total number of rows needed in  abd  is  2*ml+mu+1 .
c           the  ml+mu by ml+mu  upper left triangle and the
c           ml by ml  lower right triangle are not referenced.
