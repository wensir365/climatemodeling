**   VARIABLE INPUT PARAMETERS
*******************************************************
C      STARR - The options are: Sun, F2V,K2V,dMV
C      NSTEPS - NUMBER OF ITERATIONS
C         IMW - 0 FOR SATURATED TROPOSPHERE, 1 FOR MANABE/WETHERALD
C               RELATIVE HUMIDITY, 2 FOR M/W WITH CONSTANT
C               STRATOSPHERIC H2O CONTENT
C        RSURF - SURFACE RELATIVE HUMIDITY
C           ZY - SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE (DEGREES)
C        DTAU0 - OPTICAL DEPTH STEP IN SUBLEVEL INTEGRATION
C         ZCON - ARBITRARY CONSTANT ADDED TO Z TO KEEP IT POSITIVE
C           P0 - PRESSURE AT TOP OF GRID
c
C          PG0 - DRY PRESSURE AT BOTTOM OF GRID. 
c            G - Gravity aceleration (cm/s^2)
C          FAC - RATIO OF GRID SPACING AT TOP TO SPACING AT
C                BOTTOM
C          IO3 - 1 TO INCLUDE O3, 0 TO LEAVE IT OUT
C          IUP - SPECIFIES TYPE OF INITIALIZATION (0 IF YOU WISH TO
C                START FROM AN EXISTING SOLUTION, 1 IF YOU WISH TO
C                SPECIFY A NEW SURFACE TEMPERATURE)
C               IF OPTION 1 IS SELECTED YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT
C               THE STARTING TEMPERATURES ABOVE GROUND LEVEL ARE LESS
C               THAN TG0, SINCE THE TROPOSPHERIC LAPSE RATE IS INTEGRA-
C               TED UPWARDS IN THIS CASE.       
C         TG0 - INITIAL SURFACE TEMPERATURE (FOR IUP = 1 CASE)
C      TSTRAT - Stratospheric temperature for IUP=1. Suggestion for 
c               present Earth 220.        
C       STARR - Character variable to choose a star, it can be:
c               Sun, F2V, K2V, G2V 
c               NOTES: G2V is NOT the Sun. 
c               Write it exactly as it is listed.
c               DO NOT FORGET quotation marks.
c    ICONSERV - 0 = Non strict time-stepping method (faster)
c               1 = Each time step conservs energy (better for high CO2)  
c     ICOUPLE - 1 = Coupled to the photochemical model              
c               0 = Not coupled
c      SRFALB - Planetary albedo (0.2 for Present Earth)
c      SOLCON - Solar constant (S/So)
c       dtmax - Maximum time step in seconds    
c      CO2MAX - Maximum CO2 mixing ratio that RRTM can manage with accuracy, 
c               for greater values of CO2 the former IR subroutine is used.
c        Idry - To be used in the CONVEC subroutine
c               1 = Dry adiabat (for high CO2 atmospheres)
c               0 = Moist adiabat
