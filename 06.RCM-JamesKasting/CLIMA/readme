===   Instructions to use the 1D climate model 
         LOW CO2 VERSION
===   Developed by Dr. James Kasting, collegues and students.

The code is in fortran 77 with some fortran 90 features.

It is set to run in a linux system. Check the firsts lines of the make file to 
use the option that works better for your stystem. 

This version of the climate model is for high CO2 atmosphere and with some work it can be coupled to the photochemical.

The directory CLIMA which contains:

+ Clima.f
The main program of the climate model. A long comment at the start of the
program explains its capabilities and related publications.

+ makefile 
Executable file to compile and generate the fortran executable file that runs 
the climate model. It automatically detects when the programs have been 
compiled. 
 
+ IO/
Subdirectory with the input and output files

+ DATA/
Subdirectory with the data files that the program needs to run.

+ Subroutine subdirectories:
(Descriptions of the subroutines in the readme files within each 
subdirectory)
SETUP
CONVEC
RADTRANS
RRTM
COUPLE
PRTCL

+ CLIMA.o and RRTM.o
These subdirectories storage the *.o files that result from the compilation
of the code. 

***** To COMPILE and RUN the climate model

1. Choose the composition of the atmosphere in IO/mixing_ratios.dat
2. Choose the parameters to run the program in IO/input_clima.dat
3. Compile the climate typing:
	make -f makefile
4. Run the model typing:
	./runclima

To start from the last solution copy IO/TempOut.dat to IO/TempIn.dat
