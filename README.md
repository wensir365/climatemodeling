Climate Modeling

This project, hosted by GitHub, is aimed to provide some demo code to those students who chose the course "Climate Modeling" for better understanding the necessary concepts and skills of numerical modeling. All the code are subject to GNU/GPL license and open to the public.

We would like to thank all the students of our department.
